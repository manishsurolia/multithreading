This particular example takes any number of threads, and starts incrementing
the global counter by each thread 10000000 times.

Means, if we start 15 threads, the final value of counter should be :

    = 15 * 10000000 = 150000000

Also, it shows how much time it took for completing all the threads.
You can see that with more number of threads, the time taken is also increased.

You can also change the number of cores in the machine, and see how it impacts
the total time taken for all the threads.

[ ] gcc counter.c -lpthread
[ ] ./a.out
How many threads, do you want to create? 10
counter = 100000000, in 2502 milli-seconds
