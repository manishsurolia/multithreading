This section just shows the solution to the problem we saw in the last one,
where using only one condition variable between producer and consumer was
causing sleep to all the threads, and resulting the process hang.

The solution is simple, take 2 condition variables, one can be used by producer
thread to wait for the writing (the same will be used to signal from the
consumers and other one can be used by consumer threads to wait for the reading
(the same will be used to signal from the producers).
