This example is exactly same as the last one except that, it is using mutex
lock around critical section, so that data fetch from the address of global
variable of 'counter', updation and setting it back to the same address happens
in atomic way.

If one thread is executing the critical section code, other thread can not
start executing the same code as its locked. Other thread will wait until the
lock is released.
