This example just shows that if two processes wait for each other to compelte
(using 'pthread_join'), it creates a deadlock and the whole process gets stuck.

Thread1 waits for Thread2 to complete.
Thread2 waits for Thread1 to complete.

In this example, 'Thread1' is the main thread and the 'Thread2' is the one
created by main thread and due to 'pthread_join' call in both threads, both of
them wait for each other.
