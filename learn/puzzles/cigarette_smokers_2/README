This program is to fix the problem of cigarette smoker problem.
To understand the problem, first check the earlier section.

As explained in the earlier section, we have a deadlock when an agent provides
two resources(any of tobacco, paper and matches), then if these resources are
taken by different threads(out of three smoker threads), then the program goes
in a deadlock situation.

To solve this issue, we have to take 3 helper threads, one just waits for the
tobacco, one waits for the matches and the last waits for the paper.

As soon as any of them get the resource it will update the global variable
'flag' with its correct value.

All the smoker threads will now keep reading this 'flag' and as soon as they
get the related value of the flag, they go forward, make and consume the
cigarettes and release the agent lock. Before that they make the 'flag' also as
0. So, it again can be written freshly by the helper functions.
