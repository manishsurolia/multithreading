The only difference between this program and the last read-write program, is
that, it has a barrier code added in reader, due to which writer also get a
chance to execute, because 'sem_post()' for the barrier is done only by writer.

We can further change the program to accommodate our requirements.

[ ] gcc reader_writer.c  -lpthread
[ ] ./a.out
