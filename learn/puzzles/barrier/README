Consider again the Rendezvous problem from earlier Section.
A limitation of the solution we presented is that it does not work with more
than two threads.

Puzzle: Generalize the rendezvous solution. Every thread should run the
following code:

---------------------
    rendezvous
    critical point
--------------------

The synchronization requirement is that no thread executes critical point until
after all threads have executed rendezvous.

You can assume that there are n threads and that this value is stored in a
variable, n, that is accessible from all threads.

When the first n − 1 threads arrive they should block until the nth thread
arrives, at which point all the threads may proceed.

Solution:
--------

Solution is provided in barrier.c file.

[ ] gcc barrier.c -lpthread
[ ] ./a.out
How many thread, you want to create? 5
Executed rendezvous code.

Executed rendezvous code.

Executed Critical point.
Executed Critical point.
Executed Critical point.
Executed Critical point.
Executed Critical point.

The below pattern (from barrier.c file), a wait and a signal in rapid
succession, occurs often enough that it has a name; it’s called a "turnstile",
because it allows one thread to pass at a time, and it can be locked to bar all
threads.

if (count == n) {
    sem_post(&barrier);
}

sem_wait(&barrier);
sem_post(&barrier);

In its initial state (zero), the turnstile is locked. The nth thread unlocks it
and then all n threads go through.
