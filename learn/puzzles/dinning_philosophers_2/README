Puzzle: write a solution to this problem that prevents deadlock.
Hint: one way to avoid deadlock is to think about the conditions that make
deadlock possible and then change one of those conditions. In this case, the
deadlock is fairly fragile. A very small change breaks it.

Solution:
--------

This solution works on the idea that if there are only 'n-1' philosohers allowed
to eat when there are 'n' forks present on the table, they can not go in a
deadlock situation.

To do this, we use a multiplex, called 'footman'. This multiplex makes sure that
there can be maximum of 'MAX-1' philosophers which can apptempt to take the
forks.

Check the program to find complete details about the solution.

In addition to avoiding deadlock, this solution also guarantees that no
philosopher starves. Imagine that you are sitting at the table and both of your
neighbors are eating. You are blocked waiting for your right fork. Eventually
your right neighbor will put it down, because eat canâ€™t run forever. Since you
are the only thread waiting for that fork, you will necessarily get it next.
By a similar argument, you cannot starve waiting for your left fork.

Therefore, the time a philosopher can spend at the table is bounded. That
implies that the wait time to get into the room is also bounded.

This solution shows that by controlling the number of philosophers, we can avoid
deadlock.
