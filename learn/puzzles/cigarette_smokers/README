This is an interesting problem taken from the book 'LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf'
by 'Allen B. Downey'.

Go through the problem in the book to understand.
This program is replica of the same problem.

Important note : The agent(any of the three agent threads), can release more
ingredients only when the previously provided ingredients are consumed.
Otherwise, none of the agent thread will release any of the ingredient.

That's why,

    -   Initially 'agent_sem' has value 1, so that the any agnet thread can
        start the supply of its ingredients and then as and when the ingredients
        are completely consumed, this agent lock is released by the smoker and
        then an agent thread will take the lock and supply more ingredients, and
        so on.

    -   So, If the provided ingredients are consumed by a single smoker, we are
        good, the smoker will consume both the ingredients, make cigarette,
        smoke it and then release the agent lock. Again new ingredients will be
        released by one of the agent threads. It will just go on.

    -   But, if the released ingredients are consumed by different smokers, then
        the agent lock will not be released, as both the smokers will be waiting
        for one more ingredient and NOT do 'sem_post' for agent lock. Third
        smoker is anyway waiting for some ingredients, so no 'sem_post' for
        'agent_sem'. This is a deadlock situation. Every smoker is waiting for
        one or the other ingredient and agent is waiting for its lock.
