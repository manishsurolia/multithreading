This barbershop problem is taken from this book 'LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf' by
'Allen B. Downey'.

Below is the problem.

A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs, and the barber room
containing the barber chair. If there are no customers to be served, the barber
goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs are occupied,
then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy, but chairs are
available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is
asleep, the customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the
barber and the customers.

This solution here is written just based on the above problem statement. No
other instructions taken from the book.

To solve this problem a semaphore 'barber_sem' is taken and this is incremented
by the customers (only if chairs are available) who arrive at the barber's shop.
Also, a global customer's counter is also incremented. If the customer count is
reached to the total number of chairs, new customer leave the shop and not take
any seat as their is not empty chair present.
